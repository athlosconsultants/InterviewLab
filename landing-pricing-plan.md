# InterviewLab Landing & Pricing Page Redesign Plan

**Objective:** Improve conversion rates by removing fake social proof, sharpening copy to be outcome-focused, and restructuring the landing page to guide users through a clear journey from curiosity to conversion.

**Key Principles:**

1. Remove all unverifiable claims (fake user counts, fake testimonials)
2. Lead with AI training data credibility, not user numbers
3. Make copy outcome-focused (what users get) not feature-focused (what we have)
4. Create clear separation between mobile and desktop experiences
5. Build trust through specificity and honesty, not fabricated social proof

### E. "Common Questions" Section - Keep but Refine Copy

**Q1: KEEP AS IS**
"But I can practice with friends for free?"
A: Sure. But will they tell you exactly why your answer to 'Tell me about a time you failed' isn't STAR format? Will they ask you questions that ACTUAL companies ask? Will they track your 'um' count?

**Q2: SLIGHTLY IMPROVE**

**REPLACE WITH:**
Q: "Is AI feedback as good as human feedback?"

## PART 2: LANDING PAGE RESTRUCTURE

### Overview of Changes

The landing page currently has too many sections competing for attention. We'll restructure it to follow a clear psychological journey:

**New Structure:**

1. Hero (with 1Q widget) - KEEP AS IS
2. Why This Works (proof of mechanism) - NEW
3. What You Get (clear free vs premium) - REVISED
4. Common Questions (objection handling) - MOVED UP
5. Final CTA - NEW

**Remove entirely:**

- Fake testimonials section
- "Built for serious candidates" (intimidating)
- "Three steps" section (redundant)
- Duplicate feature grids

---

### SECTION 1: Hero - NO CHANGES

Keep the existing hero section with the 1-question widget exactly as implemented.

---

### SECTION 2: "Why This Works" - NEW SECTION

**Purpose:** Prove the AI is smart through demonstration, not claims. This replaces the fake testimonials section.

**Position:** Immediately after hero section (second thing users see when scrolling).

---

#### Desktop Layout:

**Section Background:** Light blue gradient (same as hero)

**Headline (centered):**
"See What Most People Miss"

**Subheadline (centered):**
"Our AI catches the mistakes friends won't tell you about"

**Two-Column Comparison:**

**LEFT COLUMN - Weak Answer (Red/Warning styling):**

[Small badge: "❌ WEAK ANSWER"]

**Sample question visible above answer:**
"Tell me about a time you failed."

**Weak answer text (in a card):**
"I'm a hard worker. I'm very passionate about this role. I always give 110% and I'm a team player. I really want this job because I think it would be a great opportunity for growth."

**AI Feedback (below answer card):**

- ❌ No specific example
- ❌ Generic clichés ("110%", "team player")
- ❌ No measurable results
- ❌ Doesn't actually answer the question

**RIGHT COLUMN - Strong Answer (Green/Success styling):**

[Small badge: "✅ STRONG ANSWER"]

**Same question:**
"Tell me about a time you failed."

**Strong answer text (in a card):**
"At my last internship, I misestimated a project timeline by two weeks, which delayed our product launch. I immediately notified my manager, worked with the team to redistribute tasks, and stayed late for a week to catch up. We launched only 3 days behind schedule, and I learned to build in 20% buffer time for estimates."

**AI Feedback (below answer card):**

- ✅ Clear situation (missed timeline)
- ✅ Owned the mistake
- ✅ Specific actions taken
- ✅ Quantified outcome (3 days vs 14 days)
- ✅ Shows learning and growth

**CTA below comparison (centered):**
"See what your answers are missing"
[Button: "Try Free Assessment →"]

## COPY TONE GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Do:**

- Use contractions (you're, we've, don't)
- Be specific with numbers (10,000+ interviews, not "thousands")
- Lead with outcomes (get confident, nail answers) not features
- Use second person (you/your)
- Keep sentences under 20 words where possible
- Use active voice

**Don't:**

- Make unverifiable claims about users
- Use corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "solutions")
- Overuse exclamation points
- Sound apologetic about being new
- Use "revolutionary" or "game-changing" hyperbole
- Say "just launched" or reference lack of users

---

## SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK POST-IMPLEMENTATION

1. **Landing page bounce rate** (should decrease)
2. **Free assessment sign-up rate** (should increase)
3. **Pricing page visit rate** (from landing page)
4. **Premium conversion rate** (from free assessment completers)
5. **Time on page** (should increase with better structure)
