4. **Minimal Effort**: "Everything is automated"
5. **Strong Contrast**: Free vs Premium comparison
6. **Value Stacking**: Multiple features listed with benefits
7. **Social Proof**: Testimonials and usage stats
8. **Scarcity/Momentum**: "Don't let your momentum stop"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Credit System Flow
1. User purchases pack â†’ Stripe Checkout
2. Webhook receives `checkout.session.completed`
3. Grant credits to `entitlements.remaining_interviews`
4. Log purchase in `entitlement_history`
5. User starts interview â†’ consume 1 credit
6. Log consumption in history
7. Interview completes â†’ check balance
8. If balance < 2 â†’ show upsell modal

### Double-Entry Accounting
- Credits consumed both at **session start** AND **completion**
- Start: Reserves the credit (prevents over-booking)
- Complete: Logs the actual consumption
- History table tracks all operations for audit

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- Migration 013: db/migrations/013_entitlements_phase13.sql
   ```

2. **Configure Stripe:**
   - Follow `STRIPE_SETUP.md`
   - Create 3 products in Stripe Dashboard
   - Add price IDs to `.env.local`:
     ```
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
     STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER=price_...
     STRIPE_PRICE_PROFESSIONAL=price_...
     STRIPE_PRICE_ELITE=price_...
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

3. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start dev server
   pnpm dev

   # Terminal 2: Forward Stripe webhooks
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe-webhook
   ```

4. **Test Purchase Flow:**
   - Go to `/pricing`
   - Click "Get X Interviews"
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Verify entitlement created in database
   - Check `/setup` shows paid features enabled

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics to Track

- **Conversion Rate**: Free â†’ Paid
- **Average Purchase Value**: Which tier sells most
- **Credit Utilization**: How many interviews completed per pack
- **Upsell Success**: Low-balance modal conversions
- **Time to Purchase**: Days from signup to first purchase

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- âœ… Webhook signature verification (Stripe)
- âœ… Server-side credit checking (no client-side bypass)
- âœ… RLS policies on entitlements table
- âœ… Audit logging for all transactions
- âœ… Double-entry credit accounting

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Phase 14)

1. Production Stripe setup (live mode)
2. Load testing for webhook handling
3. Add email receipts (Stripe automatic)
4. Implement refund handling (if needed)
5. Analytics dashboard for admin
6. A/B testing on pricing page
