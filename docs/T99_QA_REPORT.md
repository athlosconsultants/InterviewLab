## Known Issues

### Minor

- None identified

### Resolved During QA

- Storage bucket names corrected in validation script
- tsx and dotenv added as dev dependencies for QA tooling

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. **Monitor cache performance** - Watch cache hit/miss rates via `/api/admin/cache-stats`
2. **User acceptance testing** - Have 2-3 users test both free and paid flows
3. **Performance baseline** - Record current metrics for comparison post-Phase 9

### Phase 9 Preparation

1. **Question reveal timer** - Current implementation ready, can be enhanced
2. **Voice Orb UI** - Requires new component development
3. **Small-talk welcome** - Conversation flow logic needed
4. **Variable question counts** - Update question cap logic (5-8 per stage)
